# Solidity Security

## Reentrancy

### CEI Pattern (Checks-Effects-Interactions) — NON-NEGOTIABLE
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
    // CHECKS
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, InsufficientBalance());

    // EFFECTS (update state BEFORE external call)
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;

    // INTERACTIONS (external call LAST)
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
    require(success, TransferFailed());
}
```

### Additional Protection
- Use `ReentrancyGuard` from OpenZeppelin for complex functions
- Cross-function reentrancy: guard shared state across multiple functions
- Read-only reentrancy: be aware of view functions reading stale state during callbacks

## Access Control

| Pattern | Use When |
|---------|----------|
| `Ownable` | Single admin, simple contracts |
| `AccessControl` (roles) | Multiple roles, granular permissions |
| Multi-sig (Safe) | High-value operations, mainnet |
| Timelock | Governance, delayed execution |

- Never use `tx.origin` for authorization — use `msg.sender`
- Check `msg.sender` in modifiers, not function bodies (unless complex logic)
- Consider 2-step ownership transfer (`Ownable2Step`)

## Integer Safety

- Solidity 0.8+ has built-in overflow/underflow protection
- Use `unchecked` blocks ONLY when overflow is mathematically impossible
- Document WHY each `unchecked` block is safe
- Use `type(uint256).max` instead of magic numbers
- Watch for division-before-multiplication precision loss

## Front-Running / MEV

| Attack | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| Sandwich attacks | Slippage protection, deadline params |
| Front-running | Commit-reveal schemes |
| MEV extraction | Use Flashbots, private mempools |
| Oracle manipulation | TWAP, multiple sources |

## Oracle Security

- Never use spot price from a single DEX — use TWAP
- Chainlink: check `updatedAt` freshness, `answeredInRound >= roundId`
- Handle oracle downtime gracefully (circuit breaker)
- Use multiple oracle sources with fallback logic

## Delegate Call Risks

- Storage layout MUST match between proxy and implementation
- Never `delegatecall` to untrusted addresses
- Implementation contracts must call `_disableInitializers()` in constructor
- Watch for storage collision in proxy patterns

## Flash Loan Vectors

- Assume any amount of tokens can be borrowed in a single transaction
- Don't rely on token balances for governance weight in the same block
- Use snapshot mechanisms for voting power
- Add time-weighted checks for critical operations

## Storage Collision (Proxies)

- Use EIP-1967 storage slots for proxy state
- Never modify storage layout order in upgrades — only append
- Use `/// @custom:storage-location` for namespaced storage (EIP-7201)
- Run `forge inspect` to verify storage layout before upgrade
